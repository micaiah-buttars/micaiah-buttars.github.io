                a Web Developer and UX Designer from Salt Lake City, Utah.
                    <br/><br/>
                My long-standing appreciation of design and interest in human psychology is what initially led me to pursue UX Design, which then sparked a desire to know how to build out and code the designs I made.
                    <br/><br/>
                As a culmination of my interests in art, music, video games, and my knack for trying to make <br/>
                creative endeavours into realities; Iâ€™m currently in the process of teaching myself C++ to make a video game from scratch.

                    Alongside Lauren Irish and Spencer Vorhees, my classmates at DevMountain,
                    <br/>
                    we faithfully recreated Airbnb's desktop website to demonstrate our abilities as full stack developers
                    by using a blend of outside technologies &mdash; such as react-image-lightbox, and Airbnb's own react-dates &mdash;
                    as well as our own homebrewed functionalities, such as the on-hover effects of the listing view images.

                    OnTarget began as a personal project at DevMountain intended to assess my skills
                    with the basics of HTML, JavaScript, and React.
                    It has moved beyond that assessment into a mobile responsive web app that I am fully developing.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    As the child of an educator who had a specific need, this project was designed to meet the needs of teachers that work with students with behavioral concerns.
                    OnTarget seeks to streamline the paper/pencil data keeping process for teachers and paraprofessionals.
                    By digitizing this process, valuable time is saved, and student behavioral data is immediately available at a teacher's fingertips.
                    This allows educators to better assess the effectiveness of a student's behavior plan, and easily spot behavioral patterns in a given interval.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    OnTarget will be in beta testing at South Cache Middle School, Hyrum, UT during the 2019-20 school year.
