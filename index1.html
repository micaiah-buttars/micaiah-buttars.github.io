                a Web Developer and UX Designer from Salt Lake City, Utah.
                    <br/><br/>
                My long-standing appreciation of design and interest in human psychology is what initially led me to pursue UX Design, which then sparked a desire to know how to build out and code the designs I made.
                    <br/><br/>
                As a culmination of my interests in art, music, video games, and my knack for trying to make <br/>
                creative endeavours into realities; Iâ€™m currently in the process of teaching myself C++ to make a video game from scratch.

                    we faithfully recreated Airbnb's desktop website to demonstrate our abilities as full stack developers
                    by using a blend of outside technologies &mdash; such as react-image-lightbox, and Airbnb's own react-dates &mdash;
                    as well as our own homebrewed functionalities, such as the on-hover effects of the listing view images.
